# Drink-O-Mat
## Upgrade your Pre-Game
With the Drink-O-Mat you can easily mix drinks of your choice.
All you have to do is define the individual drinks with the mixing ratio in `config.py`. The Drink-O-Mat bartender does the rest for you.

## Hardware
[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0ERi0Bt8Gk) served as the basis for the Drinkomat. 
Since this was not enough for me, I connected a RaspberryPi with the pumps using relays and buttons.

## Notice
Due to the varying pressure in the bottels the first drink may be harder than the last one.:laughing:

Please use the Drink-O-Mat responsibly. Have fun with it!
